# Development-Enviorment-Rebuild-Guide
In order to help me sove problems when I need to install Ubuntu(Or other Linux distro again), I'm writing this file down to help me 

##1st System install  
My computer enviorment allows me to use 128 gig of my NVMe SM961 SSD and a 2Tb Seagate HDD to install Linux so I would spare them to this:  
All my SSD space would be mounted at root menu and every 1Tb of my HDD would be mounted on /home and on /usr.   
I know it is not the best or great way to spread my driver space but meh  

Usually I would go with Debian-based Linux distro so all software install codes are more or less useful on Debian based Linux.  
If your Linux distro is different from Ubuntu 18.04 LTS you should check if your distro have different name on certain applications.  
My default Linux distro for development and research is Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. I would use GNOME desktop enviorment because I'm most familar with that.  
Go with smallest install and install all applications you'll need next.  

##2nd Needed applications installation
