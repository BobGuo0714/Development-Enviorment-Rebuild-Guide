## Introduction

My device for Linux is Lenovo's ThinkPad T430 with Quad Core Intel Core i7 3630QM processor. I know I know, this is defintly *not* the Best bang for the buck processor, but it can get the job down so not a big deal. Equipped with 16Gib of DDR3 1600 Dual channel memory and 600Gib Intel S3500 Soild State Drive, it can get every job down ASAP.

## Toolchains

I'm a "programmer" in C and python, and I uses [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) as my main editor(vim and nano is *OK * per se but I'm more comfortable using GUI based editor, blame M$ for that.), and thankfully there are all these packages I need on Arch's official package libraries.  
But as a real "Pro" content creator, most apps that I rely on are missing. It's not Arch's fault, but the whole Linux community to blame.

And by device I mean a powerful PC with GeForce GTX 1060 6G and Intel Core i7 8700 and NVMe storage. When I'm under Windows or Hackintosh enviorment I can easily edit 4K video from my Nexus 6P with no lagging but it just can't happened under most linux distros I've tried. And as far as I can tell, Linux is simply not good enough for multimedia content creation in 2019.  
So what's next? I can live without QQ and Aliwangwang, and Telegram, which is my main choice as IM tool is open-source and can be easily installed simply by 

> sudo pacman -S telegram-desktop

so communication side, not a big deal.  
And for emailing/web browsering, I always uses Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox as my main dish. But, using 


## Installation

Installing Arch linux is pretty easy for me. I can install it with a phone nearby browsing Arch Linux Wiki and it's clearly a
