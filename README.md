## Introduction

This series of scripts can help me install all things I need to code.  
Git clone, bash, and copying ssh key & v2ray config file, and I'm good to go.  
I'd like to warn that all these configuartions are based on Chinese environment (include Internet\Lagnauge and time). If you're outside of China, please do not use this.  

## Installation

Use boot ISO & git clone & bash ./xxxx.sh and wait  
For server installation, please execute script with --server. If not, it will automaticlly install KDE applications and xorg.
