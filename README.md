## Introduction

My device for Linux is Elitebook 2570p from HP, which to be fair *is* a soild solution for 12" mobile computing, and Sandy Bridge i7-3630QM processor with its quad-core, hyper thread performance is overkill enough for me, but the creppy 12.5" 1366x768 TN panel is really a dealbreaker for me, and HP's bios is kinda wired that can't change the default EFI selection that causes me to go F9 and choose GRUB in order to boot in my Arch Linux.  
But, consider the whole setup(2570p,16G DDR3L RAM,480G Intel S3500)costs me less that 0.2 grad, I still consider this as a great deal.  

## Toolchains

I'm a "programmer" in C and python, and I uses [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) as my main editor(vim and nano is *OK * per se but I'm more comfortable using GUI based editor, blame M$ for that.), and thankfully there are all these packages I need on Arch's official package libraries.  
But as a real "Pro" content creator, most apps that I rely on are missing. It's not Arch's fault, but the whole Linux community to blame. I understand that there are really few people trying to edit a video on Linux, most of them choose Windows and macOS, and I also knew that there are toolkits like Blender/Kdenlive and distros build for content creation needs like Ubuntu Studio, but *they just don't work well* on my device. And by device I mean a powerful PC with GeForce GTX 1060 6G and Intel Core i7 8700 and NVMe storage. When I'm under Windows or Hackintosh enviorment I can easily edit 4K video from my Nexus 6P with no lagging but it just can't happened under most linux distros I've tried. And as far as I can tell, Linux is simply not good enough for multimedia content creation in 2019.  
So what's next? I can live without QQ and Aliwangwang, and Telegram, which is my main choice as IM tool is open-source and can be easily installed simply by 

> sudo pacman -S telegram-desktop

so communication side, not a big deal.  
And for emailing/web browsering, I always uses Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox as my main dish. But, using
